      <p>Are we alone in this universe? This is a question that undoubtedly passes through every mind several times during a lifetime. We often hear a lot of stories about close encounters, Unidentified Flying Objects(UFO) sightings and other mysterious things, but we lack documented evidence for analysis of this topic. The objective of this paper is to analyze one database which has a collection of documented reports of UFO sightings to uncover any fascinating story related to the data. Using SAS速 Enterprise Miner TM 13.1, the powerful capabilities of text analytics and topic mining are leveraged to summarize the associations between various reported sightings. We have also used PROC GEOCODE to convert addresses of sightings to the locations on the map and then used PROC GMAP procedure to produce block map to represent the frequency of the sightings in various locations. Our preliminary analysis of the data associated with sightings, it was found that the most popular words associated with UFOs tell us about their shapes, formations, movements and colors. The Text Profiler node available in SAS速 Enterprise Miner TM 13.1 is leveraged to build model and cluster the data into different levels of segment variable. We also explain how the opinions of the UFO sightings changes over a period of time using Text Profiling. Further, this Analysis is used to find interesting terms or topics and model using Text Profile node to describe the UFO Sightings.</p>
